3D printed case build for the [Krtkus](https://github.com/swift502/Krtkus) keyboard inspired by IBM Model M.

It's much more of a decorative piece than a high-quality case. The final build is essentially a mockup of something I'd love to see manufactured properly by people who know what they're doing.

## Parts

- Printed files from [production/](production/)
- Modified build of the Krtkus PCB
- 5 M2 x 6mm screws

#### Optional:

- An [Alps to MX adapter](https://www.printables.com/model/1424039) to mount vintage Alps keycaps onto MX switches
- Rubber feet

## Build

1. Screw the Krtkus PCB into the case base, it will bend to match the curvature of the support beams
2. Connect a USB cable and pull it through the hole in the back of the case
3. Assemble the rest of the case, pieces fit into each other and lock in place, no glue needed
4. Glue the logo and indicator labels onto the case
5. Done!

## Krtkus differences

The Arduino has to be soldered from the bottom of the PCB, so the case can come over it. Keep the orientation exactly the same, so the pinout matches, just attach it from the bottom.

Try to keep the pins flush with the top of the PCB. There's only about 3mm of clearance between the PCB and the case top cover.
