3D printed case build for the [Krtkus](https://github.com/swift502/Krtkus) keyboard inspired by IBM Model M. It might be more of a decorative piece than a high-quality case, but it's currently the closest thing to my ultimate dream of an authentic Krtkus Model M.

## Parts

- Printed [gcode](gcode/) files
- Printed [graphics](graphics/) images
- Fully assembled [Krtkus](https://github.com/swift502/Krtkus) PCB
- 5 M2 x 6mm screws
- Rubber feet

#### Optional:

- My [Alps to MX adapter](https://www.printables.com/model/1424039) can be used to mount vintage Alps keycaps onto MX switches

## Build

1. Screw the Krtkus PCB into the case base, it will bend to match the curvature of the supports
1. Connect a USB cable and lead it out the back of the case
1. Assemble the rest of the case, the pieces just fit into each other and lock in place
1. Attach the graphics onto the case
1. Embed the folding feet and attach rubber pads to the bottom of the case
1. Done!
