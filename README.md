3D printed case build for the [Krtkus](https://github.com/swift502/Krtkus) keyboard inspired by IBM Model M. It's more of a decorative piece than a high-quality case, but it looks nice!

## Parts

- Printed files from [production/](production/)
- [Modified](#krtkus-differences) build of the Krtkus PCB
- 5 M2 x 6mm screws

#### Optional:

- An [Alps to MX adapter](https://www.printables.com/model/1424039) to mount vintage Alps keycaps onto MX switches
- Rubber feet

## Build

1. Screw the Krtkus PCB into the case base, it has to bend to match the curvature of the supports
2. Connect a USB cable and pull it through the hole in the back of the case
3. Assemble the rest of the case, the pieces just fit into each other and lock in place
4. Glue the graphics onto the case
5. Embed the folding feet and attach rubber pads to the bottom of the case
6. Done!

## Krtkus differences

The only change required is soldering the Arduino from the bottom side of the PCB, so the top case cover can take the space usually occupied the module.
